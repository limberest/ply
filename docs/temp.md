Ply is simply a more intuitive way of autotesting your REST and GraphQL APIs.

## Autotesting Capabilities

|           |Ply|Postman|Insomnia|REST-Assured|SOAtest|ReadyAPI|
|           |:-:|:-----:|:------:|:----------:|:-----:|:------:|
|Open Source|✓  |✓      |✓       |✓           |✗      |✓       |
|Low Code   |✓  |✗      |✗       |✗           |✗      |✗       |

Start with a YAML file describing your requests. Run Ply to submit these requests and compare actual results against expected, with template literal placeholders for dynamic values. The Ply extension gives you a side-by-side diff view so you can compare results at a glance.
